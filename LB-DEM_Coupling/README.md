# LBDEMcoupling


## About
It implements the model of Noble and Torczinsky [[1]](#ref1)
for resolved coupling between particles and a fluid phase.
Original codes by Philippe Seil (https://github.com/ParticulateFlow/LBDEMcoupling-public)
enable only the coupling of spherical particles. It is extended to be also compatible
with ellipsoids modified by Qiya Shu.
